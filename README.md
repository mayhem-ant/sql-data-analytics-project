# sql-data-analytics-project

A comprehensive SQL-based data analytics project demonstrating practical implementation of exploratory and advanced analytics techniques. This project follows a structured roadmap covering essential data analysis workflows from basic exploration to sophisticated analytical methods.

## Project Overview
![Data Architecture](docs/Project Roadmap.png)
This repository showcases SQL-driven analytics across two primary domains:

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Database exploration and schema understanding
- Dimension and measure analysis with big numbers
- Date-based trend analysis
- Magnitude comparisons and ranking operations (Top N / Bottom N)

**Advanced Analytics**
- Performance metrics and KPI analysis
- Cumulative analysis and running totals
- Change-over-time trend identification
- Part-to-whole proportional analysis
- Customer/data segmentation techniques
- Automated reporting and dashboard queries

## Technical Focus

- Complex SQL queries for business intelligence
- Window functions and analytical operations
- Time-series analysis and temporal patterns
- Aggregation and grouping strategies
- Data segmentation and classification logic

This project demonstrates real-world analytical problem-solving using SQL as the primary tool for extracting actionable insights from data.
